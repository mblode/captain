Make captain self-serve. Add `captain doctor`, a preflight that checks Node, git, claude, cmux, `LINEAR_API_KEY`, and the review/PR skills the agent brief invokes (`/pr-reviewer`, `/pr-creator`, `/pr-babysitter` from `mblode/agent-skills`; `/simplify` ships with Claude Code). Publish the CLI to npm as `cmux-captain` (`npm i -g cmux-captain`; the binary stays `captain`) with a getting-started README, and fold the worktree, Linear, and fan-out logic in directly so `captain fanout` no longer depends on a separate `linear-worktree` CLI.
